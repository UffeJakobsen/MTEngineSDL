# Hello and welcome to the MTEngineSDL!

This is an application host framework for starting custom apps created using
SDL2, ImGui and OpenGL.

# How to compile

Engine compiles SDL2 with ImGui and app as static binary.
You need to compile the MTEngineSDL first.

MTEngineSDL: https://github.com/slajerek/MTEngineSDL
SDL2: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
ImGui: https://github.com/imgui

Verbose log can be switched on by commenting out `#define GLOBAL_DEBUG_OFF`
in `DBG_Log.h` file.

## macOS

cd `./platform/MacOS`
I normally put files into `~/develop/MTEngineSDL` folder. 
Project should compile as is in Xcode, remember to reference SDL library.
The precompled library is put in `~/develop/MTEngineSDL/MacOS/libs` folder.

## Windows

Check VS2019 project in `./platform/Windows`. This should work when put into
`C:\develop\MTEngineSDL`

Static SDL2 libraries are in `./platform/Windows/libs` folder.

Windows version uses LogConsole.exe app to display verbose log when compiled
without `GLOBAL_DEBUG_OFF` in `DBG_Log.h`

Fast Log Console C# project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/fastlogconsole/

# Linux

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk-3-dev libsdl2-dev libglew-dev
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ./../
make
```

Remember to have SDL2 library installed.
